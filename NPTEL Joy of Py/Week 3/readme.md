## üìù Assignment Details

### Assignment 1: Find the Second Smallest Number

#### Problem Statement

Create a Python program that finds the second smallest number in a list of positive integers (including zero). The program should prompt the user to input a list of numbers, then compute and print the second smallest number in that list.

#### Input Format

* The input consists of a single list of numbers, separated by spaces.
* **Hint**: Use the `.split()` function to convert the input into a list.

#### Output Format

* The output consists of the second smallest number in the input list.

#### Example

**Input**:

```
3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5
```

**Output**:

```
2
```

### Assignment 2: Remove Even Duplicate Numbers

#### Problem Statement

Create a Python program that removes even duplicate positive integer numbers (including zero) from a list and prints the unique numbers in the order they first appeared.

#### Input Format

* The input consists of a single list of numbers, separated by spaces.

#### Output Format

* The output consists of the unique numbers, separated by spaces, from the input list, in the order they first appeared.

#### Example

**Input**:

```
3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 3 5
```

**Output**:

```
3 1 4 5 9 2 6
```

### Assignment 3: Add Values at Even Indices

#### Problem Statement

Create a Python program that takes a list of integers, reverses the list, adds the values at even indices from both the original and reversed lists, and creates a new list with the result. The new list should be printed in the end.

#### Input Format

* The input consists of a single list of integers, separated by spaces.

#### Output Format

* The output consists of the new list of values, separated by spaces, obtained by adding values at even indices from both the original and reversed lists.

#### Example

**Input**:

```
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Output**:

```
6 2 6 4 6
```
